# Code-Refractor
Marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibilty standards so that their sit is optimized for search engines.

Refractored code:
-Semanthic HTML elements
-Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
-Accessible alt attributes.
-Sequential order.
-Concise, descriptive title.

*screenshots* How do I do that? What is the best way?
